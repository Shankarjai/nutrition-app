                            Ah, I see! Apples are a popular and <a href="#ref1">nutritious[1]</a> fruit that belong to 
                            the Malus genus. They come in a variety of types, including sweet, 
                            tart, and tart-sweet varieties, with common ones being Red Delicious,
                            Granny Smith, Fuji, and Gala. Apples are rich in vitamins
                            (especially Vitamin C), fiber, and antioxidants, making them a healthy 
                            addition to any diet. They're versatile in cooking and baking,
                            commonly used in desserts like <a href="#ref2">apple pie[2]</a>, crisps, and tarts,
                            as well as in salads, juices, and sauces. Apples have been 
                            cultivated for thousands of years and are one of the most widely 
                            consumed fruits worldwide.
